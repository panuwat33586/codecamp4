# Code Kata

How do you get to be a great musician? It helps to know the theory, and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It helps to have talent. But ultimately, greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and over again, using feedback to get better every time.

How do you get to be an All-Star sports person? Obviously fitness and talent help. But the great athletes spend hours and hours every day, practicing.

But in the software industry we take developers trained in the theory and throw them straight in to the deep-end, working on a project. It’s like taking a group of fit kids and telling them that they have four quarters to beat the Redskins (hey, we manage by objectives, right?). In software we do our practicing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. We need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. We need practice sessions.

## Rules

- No if else trap the test cases
- No other dependencies needed except the following
  - @babel/core
  - @babel/preset-env
  - @babel/node
  - babel-jest
  - chalk
  - figlet
  - jest
  - jest-extended
  
For code camper, the code kata has an expiration date for 14 days since it released. If it has expired, An answer will publish in README for each day, and you can not send the expired code kata to your TAs.

### An example of the test case traps

The test case traps are to know what the test case is passing the parameters to the function and what is test cases expect in return value.

```javascript
test('Given a string AAAABBBCCDAA should return 4A3B2C1D2A', () => {
    expect(main('AAAABBBCCDAA')).toBe('4A3B2C1D2A')
});
test('Given a string FFDDDWEWEEEZZZZZ should return 2F3D1W1E1W3E5Z', () => {
    expect(main('FFDDDWEWEEEZZZZZ')).toBe('2F3D1W1E1W3E5Z')
});
```

```javascript
function main(str) {
  if (str === 'AAAABBBCCDAA') {
    return '4A3B2C1D2A'
  } else if (str === 'FFDDDWEWEEEZZZZZ') {
    return '2F3D1W1E1W3E5Z'
  }
}
```

The above is a terrible code for dealing with real situations. If I pass a new value to the function, then the function does not handle and return what is test cases expect. A good thing is writing the function at once. I add more test cases; the function should pass all test cases without having to add any code.
